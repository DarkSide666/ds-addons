This add-on will allow you to have extended search form for Grids.

Installation:
    Check readme file of ds-addons pack.

Usage:
	Use it in Page like this:

	Example with Grid:
		$g = $page->add('gridext/Grid_Extended');
		$g->setModel('Example');
		$g->addExtendedSearch(array('name','salary','is_active','notes'));
	
	Example with CRUD:
		You can use this extended grid with CRUD too:
		$page->add('gridext/CRUD_Extended');

Known problems:
	- Not working well together with paginator (quickSearch doesn't do that
	  either).
	- If you submit your search form by pressing Enter, then isClicked=false
	  and submitted() method don't memorize token.
	- If you have checkbox in your adv.search form and don't check it, then
	  it's not sent to server on submit and as result is not taken into account
	  at all in data filtering query. For example, if you have field "is_active"
	  and you try to filter all records where is_active=false or 0.
