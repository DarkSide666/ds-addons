This add-on is a complete and quite powerful implementation of Cron job scheduler for ATK4

Installation:
    Check readme file of ds-addons pack.

Dependencies:
    ds-addons/CronExpression

Usage:
    1) Create scheduler database tables using SQL scripts found in /dbupdates.
    
    2) Create Scheduler admin page in your /page folder like this:
        class page_scheduler extends Scheduler\Page_Admin {}
    
    3) Create heartbeat.php in your root directory. It's where your index.php file is located.
        Put the following in this file:
        
        include 'atk4/loader.php';
        $api=new ApiCLI('hb');
        $api->pathfinder->addLocation('.',array('addons'=>'ds-addons'));
        $hb=$api->add('Scheduler/Heartbeat');
        $hb->execute();
    
    3) Create "hearbeat" cron job (Linux) or scheduler task (Windows). It should run script heartbeat.php created above in PHP CLI mode.
        Linux cronTab:
            http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-setup-php-script-as-cronjob/
        Windows Scheduler:
            Run: wscript.exe "ds-addons/Scheduler/tools/invisible.vbs" "ds-addons/Scheduler/tools/heartbweat.cmd"
            Start-in: directory where your heartbeat.php file is located.
            Schedule: set as you wish, but it should execute more often that your most active task. I prefer 1-5 minutes interval.

    4) Configure your scheduler using scheduler admin page:
    4a) Set scheduler global settings in "Config" tab.
        //Important is, that you set "Heartbeat time" to exactly the same value (in minutes) what scheduled in your cron tab or Windows task scheduler.
    4b) Create Tasks.
    
    5) Test it.
