        This is ATK4 addons pack made by Imants (aka. DarkSide)
        and it contains multiple addons for ATK4 version 4.2.3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:
  Download ds-addons and put it in directory ds-addons in the root of your
  server (near atk4 and atk4-addons, but not inside it). So, you'll end up
  having ds-addons directory right in your root where index.php is located.
  This way it's safer to not accidentally delete it when you are renewing
  your atk4-addons release.

USAGE:
  Add path to this addon pack in your Frontend class like this.
  $this->pathfinder->addLocation('.',array('addons'=>'ds-addons'));

 * --------------
 * Listers        - define new listers, for example, Lister_Tree.
 * Menu           - dropdown menu (horizontal and/or vertical).
